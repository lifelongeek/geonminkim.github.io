## Description
I am currently working as a research engineer at Clova Speech of Naver corporation since March 2020. In 2020, I received Ph.D. (Thesis: Generalization of neural network on unseen acoustic environment and sentence for spoken dialog system) from the School of Electrical Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) under the supervision of Prof. Soo-Young Lee. In 2012, I received B.S. from the department of Electrical Engineering (major) and Mathematical Science (minor) at KAIST.

At Clova Speech, I am developing speech recognition system on adverse condition.
